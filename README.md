# database folder:

# main.py :
It is main file , which needs to be run using command ( python main.py or python3 main.py )
Once it is executed , for testing we have to use the postman and on the postman we need to select file or multiple files and in place of key we have to write "files" as key and selecting files as value.
After execution it will return the path or you can change it to files id as well.
